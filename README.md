A simple player based on Netease Cloud Music, and it only needs to load ONE JavaScript file!

## Features
- Mobile / touch support
- Simple, beautiful & powerful
- Easy to use

## Usage
First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/M4TEC/PenguinPlayer/releases/latest) of the player from Releases.

Now, set your playlist ID by setting ```penguinplayer_id``` in ```window``` context, for example ```window.penguinplayer_id = "440401494"```. The player will initialize for you with id you provided.

Or you can initialize it anytime later by calling ```window.PPlayer.initialize("[YOUR PLAYLIST ID HERE]")```.

Then just include the JavaScript file that you just downloaded inside your page!

### Advanced usage
You can use it in a more complex way.

Initialize it with ```window.PPlayer.initialize(options: PenguinPlayerOptions)```.

Following table contains all available options.
